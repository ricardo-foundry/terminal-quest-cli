# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added (v2.1 content depth)
- 16 extra achievements spanning exploration, puzzle, combat, collection,
  speedrun and hidden categories. Auto-evaluator runs every turn.
- Three new minigames: reaction QTE (`run qte`), logic-circuit solver
  (`run logic`) and morse-code decoder (`run morse`), each with a pure
  evaluator exported for unit tests.
- Two new areas: abandoned research lab at `/world/lab/` and underground
  archive at `/shadow/archive/`, both with their own NPCs and lore.
- NPC mood system - greetings and dialog branches change with the player's
  kindness/ruthless alignment (`talk <npc> <choice-id>`).
- `achievements` grouped display by category, plus `share` command that
  writes an ASCII art score card to `~/.terminal-quest/shares/`.
- Alias system (`alias name=value`, `unalias`, persisted per save), shell
  history features (`history`, `!!`, `!<n>`) and a `complete <prefix>`
  tab-completion helper.
- In-game time and day/night cycle (dawn/day/dusk/night), with `wait`,
  `sleep`, `look` and `time` commands. Some areas are phase-gated.
- Inventory table UI grouped into consumables / equipment / key items /
  collectibles.

### Added (earlier in this release)
- GitHub issue and pull request templates, CI matrix across Node 18/20/22 on
  Ubuntu, macOS and Windows.
- `publish-npm.yml` workflow that publishes tagged releases to the npm registry
  with npm provenance.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc.json` and a
  minimal `.eslintrc.json`.
- Dependabot config for npm and GitHub Actions dependencies.
- `docs/` directory with `COMMANDS.md` and `SAVE_FORMAT.md` references.
- README rewritten in an open-source friendly style with badges, feature list,
  CLI flags table and a Chinese quick reference.

### Changed
- `CHANGELOG.md` now follows the Keep a Changelog structure with version
  deltas from `v1.0.0` to `v2.0.0` and an Unreleased section.
- Test suite grew from 24 to 51 tests covering achievements, share cards,
  time cycle, new minigames and the alias/history system.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-14

This is a large rewrite that splits the monolithic entry file into a small,
testable `src/` module tree and ships a real `bin/` CLI.

### Added
- Modular `src/` layout: `game.js`, `commands.js`, `data.js`, `ui.js`,
  `minigames.js`, `i18n.js`, `save.js`, `themes.js`.
- Multi-slot save system stored under `~/.terminal-quest/saves/*.json` with a
  `schemaVersion` field and automatic migration from the legacy single-file
  save.
- Bilingual UI (English / Chinese) selectable at runtime or via `--lang`.
- Theme engine with `dark`, `light` and `retro` presets, switchable in-game or
  via `--theme`.
- 18 achievements that grant EXP on unlock, a 7-tier level progression and an
  inventory for key fragments and quest items.
- 5 minigames: snake, guess-the-number, matrix-rain, pong and a Wordle clone.
- 12 main-story quests, guide / merchant NPC dialogues and an endgame secret.
- 5 explorable zones with hidden files, encrypted notes and three key shards.
- Node's built-in test runner: 24 tests covering commands, i18n, minigames,
  game state and the save subsystem.
- `bin/terminal-quest.js` entry point with `terminal-quest`, `tq` and
  `adventure` binaries.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with setup, architecture and testing guidance.

### Changed
- `package.json` bumped to `2.0.0`, `engines.node` pinned to `>=14.0.0`, and
  `files` narrowed to `bin/`, `src/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE` for a smaller tarball.

### Fixed
- Non-TTY environments (CI, pipes) now degrade gracefully instead of crashing
  on `process.stdin.setRawMode`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- First public release.
- Terminal filesystem explorer with `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `pwd` and friends.
- Hidden-file discovery mechanic.
- Early achievement prototype.
